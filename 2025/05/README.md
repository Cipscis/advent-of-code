## Part one

This is a very easy puzzle. The input is slightly more complex to parse than previous inputs because it comes in two parts, but once it's parsed then it's just a matter of checking which of a bunch of numbers fit within any of a number of ranges.

I made a `Range` class, mainly since I have been tidying up my `Grid` and `Cursor` classes that I made for yesterday's puzzle. Working with classes involves thinking a little differently to how I normally do, so when it's a reasonable option I figure maybe it'll help me think about things in new ways.

Anyway. For my input, the correct solution to part one was **607**.

## Part two

TODO

For my input, the solution to part two was **TODO**.
